# GridScript
A project to create a useful 2D level editor in Unity

Born out of the need to have a fast way to build/test different level designs and mechanics quickly. This started as a small project for a platformer I was building as a personal project in Unity, then grew even more useful when I implemented it into a tower defence game. 

The code allows a user to place/remove tiles with left/right clicks respectively. I have also added in a few useful functions, such as the ability to scale the tiles to any size. In development the characters would slip between the tiles and be lost forever, but by adding in the scaling tiles it solved every clipping issue. 

An extremely useful part of this code is that it works from prefabs, meaning you can place almost anything as a tile in the editor. 

NOTE: parts of this script are from an asset on the Unity Asset Store. At the time of writing the asset as been taken down and I have been unable to locate or credit the original autor(s). If anyone knows who I would credit the code to please let me know.
